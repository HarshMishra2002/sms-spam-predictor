# sms-spam-predictor
I have made an End to End ML project where we will predict the SMS/Email as spam or not a spam.

Ever wondered how google puts some of your mails in spam section even without asking you. Today we will create the same. A ML model that can detect your SMS weather as a spam or not a spam

All the datils of the code and project has been mentioned in my medium blog so do give it a check
